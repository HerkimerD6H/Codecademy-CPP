// Lesson:            01 - Hello World
// Project Name:      01 - Block Letters
// Project File:      initials.cpp
// Instructions:      Write a C++ program called initials.cpp that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown:
        // Block Letters
        // Tasks
        // 8/8 complete  Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
        // What we are building in this project:
        // 1. My initials are S and L, so my initials.cpp program should output: (initials). What are your initials? Take a look at the complete alphabet.
        // Setting up:
        // 2. First, write a comment with a fun fact about yourself!
        // 3. And letâ€™s create a skeleton for the program:
              // #include <iostream>
              // int main() {
              // Your program lives here:
              // }
              // Output your initials:
       // 4. Output your first initial. Press Save to save your program.
       // 5. Compile and execute to make sure you got the result. To compile, type the following after the $ sign and press enter: g++ initials.cpp. To execute, type the following and press enter: ./a.out
       // 6. Output your second initial. Press Save to save your program.
       // 7. Compile and execute to make sure you got the result.
       // 8. If you get stuck during the project or would like to see an experienced developer work through the project, watch the project walkthrough video.


//******** My Project Begins Here:************//

// My fun fact is that I have NVLD, which is a visual-spatial learning disability, and frankly, I am nervous about trying to get the spacing correct! 
// I didn't know I had NVLD 20 years ago when I was trying to learn programming the first time! I am appreciative of the clearly gridded block letters graphic!

//include library
#include <iostream>

//main program
int main() {
  std::cout<< "  CCC      M       M      CCC \n";
  std::cout<< " C   C     MM     MM     C   C\n";
  std::cout<< " C         MM     MM     C    \n";
  std::cout<< " C         M   M   M     C    \n";
  std::cout<< " C         M       M     C    \n";
  std::cout<< " C   C     M       M     C   C\n";
  std::cout<< "  CCC      M       M      CCC \n";
}
