// Lesson:            05 - Vectors
// Project Name:      01 - Vector Size
// Project File:      size.cpp

    // .size()
    // <std::vector> not only stores the elements; it also stores the size of the vector:
    // .size() function returns the number of elements in the vector.
    // For example, suppose we have a std::string vector with Sonnyâ€™s grocery list:
    // std::vector<std::string> grocery = {"Hot Pepper Jam", "Dragon Fruit", "Brussel Sprouts"};
    // Instructions
    // Checkpoint 1 Passed
    // 1. Add a few more items to the grocery list using .push_back(). Print the size of grocery using .size(). Is it the same as you expected?


//******** My Project Begins Here:************//
//the libraries and initial vector were declared for me in the exercise
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
int main() {
  
  std::vector<std::string> grocery = {"Hot Pepper Jam", "Dragon Fruit", "Brussel Sprouts"};

  // I added this int to use as a counter - declare and initalize
  int i = 0; // added by me

  // Add more << this instruction comment was given by the project, and I added these three elements below 
  grocery.push_back("Blue Cheese"); // Delicious! Plus carrots and celery if we are feeling fancy :) 
  grocery.push_back("Chicken Wings"); // Go Bills! Extra crispy please! Drums and flats are both good!
  grocery.push_back("AW Root Beer"); // Ice cold and amazing!

// I wrote this line to output the number of elements in the vector using .size()
  std::cout << "Number of Elements: " << grocery.size() <<"\n";

// I added this while loop to output each of the elements collected in the vector
// Since the first element is Element 0, but the Count (number) of elements begins with 1:
// I can use one int (here - i) to both keep track of the element number and be the stopping condition comparator with grocery size
// there are 6 elements here and the element numbers go from 0-5
  while (i < grocery.size()) {
    std::cout << "Element Number: " << i << " | Element Name: "<< grocery[i] << "\n";
    i++;
  }
