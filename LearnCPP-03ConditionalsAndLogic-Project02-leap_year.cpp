// Lesson:            03 - Conditionals and Variables
// Project Name:      02 - Leap Year
// Project File:      leap_year.cpp
      //Instructions
      // Optional: Let’s try a challenging problem that will put all your brain cells to the test.
      // Write a leap_year.cpp program that:
            // Takes a year as input.
            // Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
            // Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.
      // There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:
            // If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, however…
            // If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
            // If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
      // Take some time to research and brainstorm before starting to write the code!
