# Codecademy-CPP

This repository will hold the Project files I have created while taking C++ classes on Codecademy.
Project Files will be named CourseName-Lesson-Project. 
The project instructions will be included in comments in each of the files.
The code is entirely written by me unless annotated otherwise in the comments.
I am stating here that I am not using the AI assistants, or any AI, to complete the code that I am posting here in the repository.
